# qmc-pi-estimation

## Overview
The Quasi-Mone Carlo π estimation algorithm is a set of tools based on
the Monte Carlo method. The program runs Quasi (QMC) and ”normal” Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations, plots their convergence rates and graphs the scatter
plot of points used in the QMC. 

This project is designed to highlight the differences between random and de-
terministic sampling approaches. At the same time, it helps further develop my
Python programming skills and lays the foundation for more complex, statistic-
heavy topics.
